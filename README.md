## *Analysis*

Because the analysis will be conducted in a Google Colab Notebook, you will need to configure the worskspace and connect your data to your Drive. This is done by mounting the Drive into the Notebook, connecting the filepath and creating a DataFrame (of the data):


```
# Upload the "google_hourly_search_trends.csv" file into Colab 
# then store in a Pandas DataFrame
# Set the "Date" column as the Datetime Index.
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
from google.colab import files
file_path = Path("/content/drive/MyDrive/challenge_11/Resources/google_hourly_search_trends.csv")
df_mercado_trends = pd.read_csv(file_path, index_col="Date", infer_datetime_format=True, parse_dates=True)
```

There are mutliple steps that need to be accomplished to analyze the financial and user data of Mercado Libre, and the first one was for locating possible patterns of Google Search trends. 

It was evident that searches of Mercado increased during specific days in a week and even hours. The below graph shows the weekly search trends of Mercado as well as the heatmap to show these evident trends in the searches.

![Mercado_Search_Trends_Heatmap](Resources/Mercado_weekly_heatmap.png)


Based on the graphs it can be noted that there is an increase in search trends in the beginning of a week during late hours (between 20:00 - 00:00).

After analyzing the search trends, we now need to continue by reviewing the data of the stock price and see if they increase during the times when the search trends are the highest and vice versa (correlation).

To analyze this data, we took the first six months of the year 2020 stock prices and search trends. The data produced the following graphs:

![Mercado_search_stock_corr](Resources/search_stock_corr.png)

![Mercado_search_stock_corr_2](Resources/search-stock_corr_2.png)


By these graphs it is evident that there is some correlation, but not a whole lot.

Following this analysis, we conducted a forecast for the popularity of Mercado through Facebook Prophet.


To do a prediction through Prophet, we would need to create a Dataframe out of the google search trends and reset the index so that the both the date and google search trends are columns.

```
#Using the df_mercado_trends DataFrame, reset the index so the date information is no longer the index
mercado_prophet_df = df_mercado_trends.reset_index()

#Label the columns ds and y so that the syntax is recognized by Prophet
mercado_prophet_df.columns = ['ds', 'y']

#Drop an NaN values from the prophet_df DataFrame
mercado_prophet_df = mercado_prophet_df.dropna()
```

Afterwards, we create a model, fit it to our data, create a dataframe for future trend predictions and then make the actual predictions.
The resulting dataframe we look like the following snippet with 22 columns predicting:
- trend
- yhat_lower	
- yhat_upper	
- trend_lower	
- weekly	
- weekly_lower	
- weekly_upper	
- yhat
- and more

Based on the predictions, Mercado Libre popularity will decrease.

Further analysis was done on Mercado to infer the revenue for the next quarter. For the quarter of July 2020 - August 2020 the estimate results are:
- Best likely revenue will be \\$23.52 million
- Worse likely revenue will be \\$19.72 million
- Most likely revenue will be \\$21.62 million
